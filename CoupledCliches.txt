Github submission for the Game Off 2022 Game Jam.

I cannot share the code or assets directly as they are paid assets.

I programmed the game using Game Creator from Catsoft Studios.

The assets were from Synty Studios, Meshtint, MalberS, and polyperfect.

Thank you for playing my game and I appreciate your comments.

The game was made in less than a month with a few hours a day as I had time after work.  

Good luck to all who submitted and I look forward to playing your games.
